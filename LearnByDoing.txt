Create a frontend using the DOG API. 
The frontend should have following features:
1.	Menu bar with two options : List All Dogs, Search Dogs
2.	List All Dogs should be the default landing page
3.	List All Dogs should list all the breeds of dogs. The below api can be used. If there are any subdivisions of the breed they should also be mentioned: https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all
4.	On click of the dog breed, the images for that breed should be shown. The below api can be used for it:
https://dog.ceo/api/breed/{your breed}/images

5.	You can go through this https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/ for further clarifications on how the api works.
